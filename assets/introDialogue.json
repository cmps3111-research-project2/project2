Our mission is to make this village more digitally friendly and bring new opportunities to the community.\nIan: Our first task is to head to the local school. That’s where we’ll be meeting some of the teachers and students, and we’ll get a better idea of what they need from us. I think they’re a bit curious about what we’re doing here, so let’s make a good first impression!\nIan: Alright! Let’s make a difference—one step at a time.",
